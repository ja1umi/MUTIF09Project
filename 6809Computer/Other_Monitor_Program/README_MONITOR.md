# Yet another MONITOR program for MUTIF09 SBC

I ported wnoy's MIKIBUG-like monitor program to my MUTIF09 SBC but unfortunately, his/her web site has gone beyond the event horizon, as Geocities quit having free web sites.

However, one door cleses, another door opens. Leo (@Leo_yumesichi) succeeded in porting some famous monitor program (e.g. ASSIST09, SBUG and OMEN MIcro's Kilo Monitor) to MUTIF09 SBC. Pleae refer to the following link. Thanks Leo!
