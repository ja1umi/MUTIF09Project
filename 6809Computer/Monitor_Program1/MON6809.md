# Monitor Program for MUTIF09 SBC (1)

A forerunner (wnoy) wrote a small, MIKIBUG-like monitor program for his/her homebrew 6809-based single board computer (SBC).

I ported the monitor to my MUTIF09 6809 SBC and it worked nicely. To build it, you have to download the source code and my patch, apply the patch to the source with the patch and then re-assemble (asm6809 can be used).
