# MUTIF09 Project

MUTIF09 (or shortly MUTIF) project is my hobby project for developent of tiny homebrew computers and their add-on/expansion boards (e.g. Arithmetic coprocessor and I/O expansion board) simple enough for building and maintenance, focusing on 80s-era microprocessors (e.g. Motorola's MC6809) just for fun.

FAQ

    Updates are available when they are released.

2. What does MUTIF mean?

    MUTIF is an anagram of two amaterur radio call signs of my own (suffix only).

3. How to assemble this thing? / Where is the assembly manual?

    Refer to the schematic(s), order the PCB(s), collect parts required, populate the parts on the PCB just as you did in your other DIY electronics project. Knowledge of basic soldering techniques is also required. Remember to get your PC ready with USB-TTL serial cable installed because MUTIF09 single board computer has a serial console only.
