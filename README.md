# MUTIF09 Project

MUTIF09 (or shortly MUTIF) project is my hobby project for developent of tiny homebrew computers and their add-on/expansion boards (e.g. Arithmetic coprocessor and I/O expansion board) simple enough for building and maintenance, focusing on around 1980s-era microprocessors (e.g. Motorola's MC6809, Harris' HD-6120) just for fun.
