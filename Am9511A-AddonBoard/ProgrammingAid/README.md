# Decimal number-binary floating point representation conversion worksheets

## What is it?

SSIA.

The Excel worksheets are composed of two parts: decimal (say, 0.5) to 32-bit floating point representation in hexadecimal and vice-versa.

Interconversion to and from floating point representation is cumbersome but necessary for Am9511A  programming. I hope the worksheets help (at least, it works for me).

## How to use it?

The worksheets are self explanatory (I hope so).
